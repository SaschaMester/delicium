         The value of this string may be overridden in an APK by including a
         string with the same name but a different value (e.g. "Chrome Shell").

         Note: this must live in app_name.xml rather than
         android_chrome_strings.grd so the string isn't copied into every
         language (which makes it impossible to override the string from a
         single strings.xml file). -->
